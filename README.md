# Truth_Lie_detection

Lie detection is considered a concern for everyone in their day to day life given its impact on human interactions. Thus, people normally pay attention to both what their interlocutors are saying and also to their visual appearances, including faces, to try to find any signs that indicate whether the person is telling the truth or not. Building from the above, the detection of deceptive behavior using facial analysis has been proved feasible using macro and, especially, micro-expressions. Therefore the aim of this project is to create a system that detects lies or deception using facial analysis .
